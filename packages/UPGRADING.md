# Upgrading

## 0.2.0 → 0.2.1

`@okjt/dashboard` 0.2.1. The page title, its icon box, summary-card and
toolbar shadows and the bell's dot follow the theme (they had Naoa's colours
written in; the values are the same for Naoa). The sign-in fields' three
copper tones follow the theme too, unless the app sets them in its CSS:

```css
:root {
  --okjt-auth-glow: #D08A5E;        /* where the sign-in button's gradient ends */
  --okjt-auth-focus: #C49274;       /* a focused field's border and ring */
  --okjt-auth-placeholder: #B8A898; /* placeholders */
}
```

`AdminTutorial` with no steps no longer breaks the page.

## 0.1 → 0.2

`@okjt/dashboard` 0.2.0 and `okjt/laravel-kit` v0.2.0. Nothing is removed or
renamed; everything new is opt-in.

**Server (`okjt/laravel-kit`)**

* New: Google sign-in and passkeys, backups, the console and its audit log,
  accounts and teams, and billing. See the README for each.
* Laravel merges a package's config only at the top level. If your
  `config/okjt.php` has its own `messages` or `auth` section, copy the new
  keys from the kit's `config/okjt.php` into it:
  * `messages`: `sign_in_expired`, `account_not_found`, `confirm_address`,
    `team_owners_only`, `no_account`, `plan_limit`, `trial_limit`;
  * `auth`: `new_user_name`, `social`.
  New sections (`backups`, `console`, `accounts`, `billing`) come from the
  kit unless you override them.
* New tables, only if you use those parts:
  `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=okjt-migrations` then `php artisan migrate`
  (console audit log, accounts, billing). Each skips tables you already have.
* `backups:create` and `backups:verify` now come from the kit; delete your own
  commands with those names.
* `AUTO_BACKUPS` is read as `okjt.backups.auto`.

**Client (`@okjt/dashboard`)**

* New: the shell's account menu (`AccountMenu`), the sign-in pages
  (`AuthLayout`, `SignInPage`, `GoogleCallbackPage`, `VerifyEmailPage`,
  `AcceptInvitePage`), the passkey client, and `signedIn(result)` on
  `useAuth()`.
* `SignInPage` needs `react-hook-form` (a new peer dependency).
